## Localization

This project makes use of localization wherever possible. If you want to add translations for a language, you can do so by creating a pull request. Please do not
use AI or use a translator to one-to-one translate values but it's fine as a supportive tool. Adding translations for non-vanilla languages are accepted as well.
If you are unsure about certain translations, mention it in form of a comment in the translation file and omit the key-value pair.
