# AnimationStudio

Minecraft Bedrock Edition 1.20 introduced the `camera` command that allows us to create tracking shots. However it might happen that you loose the overview of the
**keyframes**. This add-on adds a simple to use GUI for creating and editing **scenes**.

You can trigger animations with either `/scriptevent animstud:play sceneID` or you can **export** your scenes which means a sequence of commands will be outputted
to the chat. When you put these commands in command blocks, you can even remove the add-on.
